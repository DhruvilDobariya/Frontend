Alternative of HTML:
XHTML: Extensible Hypertext Markup Language
Combination of best parts of html and xml 
XML case sensitive, HTML not
We must end every tag like input and br
We must use case sensitive Ex: We can't write <BODY></BODY> instat of <body></body>, but in html we can
XHTML document must have an XHTML <!DOCTYPE> declaration
<html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> elements must also be present
xmlns attribute in <html> must specify the xml namespace for the document
File Extension: .xhtml, .xht, .xml, .html, .htm
Namespace: logical grouping of names used in a program
namespace is important to include: http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml other wise it give output in plain XML.

Meta Tag:
charset: charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
UTF-8: Unicode Transformation Format version 8: It is a set of symbol and charector whicontent attribute gives the value associated with the http-equiv or name attributech use to understand browser engine to know which type of chrecter we use in particular document
content: content attribute gives the value associated with the http-equiv or name,  attribute
name: name is used to specify metadata about document like keywords, discription, author
http-equiv: It is used to simulate an HTTP responce header. like document refrace every 30 second, this type of information write using http-equiv attribute
=> Also it is used for give multiple language whcih use whith lang attribute of <html>

Viewport:
Initially web sufer on only desktop, but over the time mobile and tablat come in picture, so it can't adjust large size of page that's why we are using viewport which help use to set size of web page quickly, but not parfectly.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
width=device-width: it set web page width based on device width
initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is load

Why XHTML:
Need for XHTML: 
XHTML has a more strict syntax rules in comparison of HTML. XHTML gives you a more consistent, well structured format so that your webpages can be easily parsed and processed by present and future web browsers. It also makes your website more easy to maintain, edit, convert and format in the long run.

Benefits:
1. XHTML documents are XML conforming. As such, they are readily viewed, edited, and validated with standard XML tools.
2. XHTML documents can be written to operate better than they did before in existing browsers as well as in new browsers.
3. XHTML documents can utilize applications like scripts and applets that rely upon either the HTML Document Object Model or the XML Document Object Model.
